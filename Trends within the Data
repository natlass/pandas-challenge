1.)  From the data collected, it is evident there is an overwhelming majority of male gamers within the Pymoli community, accounting for a whopping 84% of their user base.

2.)  Their user age demographic seems to fall within the 20-24 year old group, with nearly half of their users fitting this description.  This is followed not-so-closely by the 15-19 year old demographic group, with approximately 18% of their user base.

3.)  From the most popular item analysis, it appears the item Final Critic is bought most often and also brings in the most profit for the game. This is followed closely by Oathbreaker.  Both appear to offer significant advantages since they are bought most often but also are the most costly to afford.
