### Heroes of Pymoli
=======================

In this project, I will be analyzing data for a fantasy game, **Heroes of Pymoli**.
A small, start-up video game developer has hired me to analyze some statistics about the game, and offer some valuable insights into their user demographic and most profitable or popular items within the game.
This homework assignment should utilize the knowledge gained from the Pandas unit from Penn's Bootcamp Data Analysis and Visualization, and showcase skills particularly within binning, DataFrames, and groupby, among other objectives.  Using Jupyter notebook from a local directory, the final code should be uploaded to a GitHub repository--like this one!
#
The final code listed in the document should offer valuable insights into the game's purchasing data, with real-world applications on non-imaginary business purchasing information as well.
